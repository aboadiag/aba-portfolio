Hi, my name is Abena (she/her)! I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University where I am advised by [Aaron Steinfeld](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/aaron-steinfeld/) and a part of the [TBD Lab](https://tbd.ri.cmu.edu/).

My research interests are at the intersection of **human-robot interaction** and **accessibility**. I am broadly interested in applying human-centered design approaches to design intelligent agents that can support people with disabilities. 

I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work as an undergraduate researcher in [SHAPE Lab](https://shape.stanford.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Sean Follmer, at the [Clayman Institute](https://gender.stanford.edu/) for Gender Research with Dr. Melissa Abad, and at the [Stanford Graduate School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/willinsk) with Dr. John Willinsky. 


I am passionate about uncovering technology solutions that enable people to live empowered lives. If you are interested in collaborating, send me an email with your interests!


When I am not doing research, you can find me doing yoga, bouldering, rollerblading, creating artwork, or playing with my cats, Bee and Bug!

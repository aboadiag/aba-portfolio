As a researcher, I am passionate about creating technology that empowers people.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **accessibility** and **human-robot interaction**.

The main goal of my current work is aimed at designing assistive agents that perform tasks and behave in ways that are desirable for users to ensure their adoption and sustained acceptance amongst diverse populations of people with disabilities.

Currently, I focus on the design and evaluation of the following types of agents:

- **Socially assistive agents** to promote mental wellbeing  
- **Assistive robots** that support people who are blind or have low vision (BLV) and people with physical or motor disabilities with mobility-related tasks, specifically in-door navigation and last-mile delivery tasks

As I am an HRI researcher, I use mixed-methods approaches. Broadly, I leverage tools from across disciplines, including **robotics**, **design research**, **HRI**, **HCI**, and **psychology**. Specifically, I use qualitative methods (i.e., participatory and co-design) to design agent behaviors.  I also use qualitative methods to evaluate the effectiveness of these behaviors on human users (i.e., the degree to which users view a robot as empathic during a therapeutic task).


In the past, I have worked on **haptic tools** to support BLV students and their educators.

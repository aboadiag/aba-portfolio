As a researcher, I am passionate about creating technology that empowers people.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **accessibility** and **human-robot interaction**.

Currently, I focus on developing:

- **Socially assistive agents** to promote mental wellbeing  
- **Assistive robots** that support people with disabilities in daily tasks

I leverage tools from across disciplines, including **robotics**, **design research**, **HRI**, **HCI**, and **psychology**.

In the past, I have worked on **haptic tools** to support students who are Blind or have Low Vision (BLV) and their educators.
